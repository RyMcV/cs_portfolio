# Ryan McVicker's Portfolio of Computer Science projects

1. Creating Customer Segments: Applied unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor to identify customer segments hidden in the data.

2. Dog Breed Classifier: Using a Convolutional Neural Networks, built a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images, so that the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.

3. Finding Donors: Employed several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census, to select the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data.

4. HMM Speech Tagging: Built a hidden Markov model for part-of-speech tagging using a universal tagset.

5. Image Classifier: Built and trained a deep neural network on the flower data set with PyTorch.

6. Predicting Housing Prices: Explored the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset and determined a suitable performance metric for this problem to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data.

7. Teaching a Quadcopter to Fly: Designed an actor-critic model algorithm based on deterministic policy gradient in continuous action spaces.

8. Machine Translation: Built a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline, accepting English text as input and returning the French translation.
